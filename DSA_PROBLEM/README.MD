These lines import necessary classes and data structures from the Java standard library, including HashMap, Map, ArrayList, and List, which we'll use to store and manipulate data.

public class TravelRouteFinder 

We define a class named TravelRouteFinder to encapsulate our code. This class contains the logic for finding the travel route.

findRoute method :
public static List<String> findRoute(String[] tickets) 

This method is declared as public and static, which means it can be called from outside the class without creating an instance of TravelRouteFinder. It takes an array of ticket strings as input and returns a list of strings (representing the route).

creating ticketMap:

Map<String, String> ticketMap = new HashMap<>();

We create a Map called ticketMap to store the available tickets. This map will associate departure cities with their corresponding arrival cities.

populating ticketMap:
for (String ticket : tickets) {
    String[] parts = ticket.split("-");
    String departure = parts[0];
    String arrival = parts[1];
    ticketMap.put(departure, arrival);
}

Here, we iterate through the array of ticket strings and split each ticket into departure and arrival cities using the hyphen ("-") as the delimiter. We then add these cities to the ticketMap, where the departure city is the key, and the arrival city is the value.

Initialize currentCity and route:

String currentCity = "Kiev";
List<String> route = new ArrayList<>();

We start the route finding process from Kiev (as specified in the problem). We also initialize an empty list called route to store the cities visited in sequence.

Traversing the Route:

while (ticketMap.containsKey(currentCity)) {
    String nextCity = ticketMap.get(currentCity);
    route.add(currentCity);
    currentCity = nextCity;
}

We use a while loop to traverse the route. As long as the ticketMap contains an entry for the currentCity, we continue traveling. We add the currentCity to the route list and update currentCity to the next city according to the ticket information.

Adding Final Destination:

route.add(currentCity);

After the loop, we add the final destination city to the route.

Returning the Route:

return route;

Finally, we return the route list, which represents the route your son traveled

Testing in main Method:

In the main method, we create an array tickets with the available ticket strings and then call the findRoute method to find the route. We print the result to the console.

I hope this step-by-step explanation helps you understand the Java code better. If you have any more questions or need further clarification on any part of the code, please feel free to ask!
